### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer passionate about **Flutter** and **Dart**.

- Iâ€™m investigating the bridge between **developers** and **designers**
- Iâ€™m currently learning **native development** and **dutch**
- Ask me about mobile, web, or anything random
- Feel free to reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/francescocops), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/azzecca-garbugli) or anywhere you wish
- I love football, volleyball, and climbing mountains

I'm also part of the [Maker Space](https://pdp.linux.it/makerspace/) group in [Fabriano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabriano), a super nerdy space where we build fancy projects and we try to share them with the local communities.

Working on Open Source is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possibly can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you. Thanks for visiting my dear friend!
